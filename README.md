Solution to capture all the syscalls generated by newly spawned containers and generate a Seccomp Profile whitelisting those captured syscalls.

# [Mitigation](https://github.com/0xSmiley/Runtime/blob/master/Mitigation/README.md) <br/>
  If you have a working proof of concept you will be able to detect the syscalls that the exploit uses.
  
# [Fuzzer](https://github.com/0xSmiley/Runtime/blob/master/Fuzzer/README.md) <br/>
  Used to fuzz containers in order to increse the syscalls coverage.
